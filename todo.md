- [ ] Read initial settings from JSON (status: mostly done)
- [ ] Store/retrieve state as a hashable value
- [ ] Generate all current states from current state (@Jonathan)
- [ ] Draw node chart using PyViz

## Problems to decide:
- [ ] How are we going to resolve ambiguities with current derivatives?
